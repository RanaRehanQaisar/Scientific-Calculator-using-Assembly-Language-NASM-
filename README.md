# Scientific-Calculator-using-Assembly-Language-NASM-
The main objective of this project is to design a Scientific Calculator using the assembly language.

Requirements:
Nowadays most of the computer architecture is based on 32 or 64 bits. So to run this project we need an 8-bit operating system and you can download NASAM for it and see the results on the NSAM interface, which will show the changes occurring in the registers and flags etc.
